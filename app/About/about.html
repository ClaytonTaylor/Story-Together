            <p class="left black-text">We are a team of Story-Tellers that are passionate about Stories. More specifically, the stories that go untold. We believe that the Era of a Studio-Dominated Film Industry is over. With the introduction of the internet, we now have the capability to tell our own stories. But there is a problem every Filmmaker faces.</p>

          <div class="icon-block">
            <p class="left black-text">Unless you work for a studio or have a large list of connections, your path to the "Big Screen" is severley limited by who you know. Filmmaking is a Team Effort, but what if you don't know any Writers, or Camera Operators, Costume Designers, or even Grips? You are forced doing jobs you don't specialize in and, as a result, don't focus your speciality and the overall quality of your Story dimenishes. Or, you spend days, weeks, or even months looking for the right people for the right job.</p>
